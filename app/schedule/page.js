          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed" >During the Covid pandemic, as we know, everyone was locked down and unable to interact personally. Many people turned to online communication, but for those who worked in shops or were accustomed to working with others, this was extremely difficult.</p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed" >However, some found creative ways to overcome these obstacles. Ian Davlin and James Rodman, for example, developed a system for creating jigs and fixtures. They traded information online, outsourced the production of these tools to facilities, and then had the finished products shipped directly to their homes. They will discuss their process for online collaborations and tool development. </p>
